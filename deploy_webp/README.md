Deploy WebP
=========

This role will build the WebP from the source files, make the config for NGINX and add the call to the main NGINX config.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: yourhosts
      roles:
         - deploy_webp
